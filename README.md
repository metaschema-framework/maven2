# Metaschema Framework Maven Artifact Repository

This [independant public repository](https://maven.apache.org/repositories/) contains build artifacts for use with [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/). These artifacts are published here to provide access to developmental `-SNAPSHOT` builds that are not published as a matter of standard practice to [Maven central](https://maven.apache.org/repository/index.html).

Please refer to the [introduction to Maven repositories](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-repositories.html) for more information about how to use this repository.
